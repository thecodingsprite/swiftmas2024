The 12 Days of Swiftmas is back for 2024

Welcome to Swiftmas 2024. An ios Development challenge for programmers of all levels. Starting December 13th each day we will be building a new app in the countdown to Christmas. A slight change of dates compared to last year.

Around 9am (GMT) I will post a prompt for a app idea on thecodingsprite.com & social media (@thecodingsprite). For those more experienced & those wanting to give it a go then I can't wait to see your projects on social media. Remember to use the hashtag #The12DaysOfSwiftmas & tag me @thecodingsprite

Then around midday each day, I will be posting my idea/version here on github, a completed snapshot of the code on social media & a full detailed tutorial on the website www.thecodingsprite.com for anyone who is still a bit green shall we say & not confident in pursuing their own code from the get go or wanting to indeed learn through another devs thought process.

I truly hope everyone enjoy's this fun challenge & that we can all learn something from each other. No nastiness, only ever constructive criticism please. It's going to be a fun ride & for everyone that joins in the full 12 days I have a Certificate of Completion with your name on it if you wish.

Look forward to seeing all your projects, üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
